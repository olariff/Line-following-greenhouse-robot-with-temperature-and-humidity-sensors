# Line-following-greenhouse-robot-with-temperature-and-humidity-sensors
In an indoor strawberry farm, it is crucial to maintain a constant temperature and humidity for optimal crop growth. This is a tricky process as simply opening a door can create a microclimate. It is important that the temperature and humidity is equally distributed throughout the greenhouse to avoid microclimate. This report describes line follower robot, which follows a line drawn around the greenhouse and constantly records temperature and humidity. In a event the temperature and humidity is a abnormal from the reference values, the robot stops and sounds a alarm to inform the greenhouse workers. The sections of the final report provides all the technical documentation for this project. The technical documentations outlines the design and development process of the line follower. The design considers a compilation of components which is be used to construct a robot. The components are used to create a PCB design which is to be used in the final product. The devlopment focuses on the software, which is used to perform a set task using the avaliable components. The project is designed to be implemented using the ARM mbed NXP LCP1768 microcontroller, which is generally used for rapid prototyping applications.
