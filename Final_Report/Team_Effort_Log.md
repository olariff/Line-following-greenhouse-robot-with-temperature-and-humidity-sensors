### Sprint 5 (Week 20 & 21):
- [This subtask](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-139) was assigned by Ahmad and compleated by me in sprint 5. This is a subtask of a story. The task involved creating a skeleton code, building a foundation for the final code. This story has been done by Ahmad, myself and Robert. I spent 3 hours in his contribution towards this skeleton code. This task has 20 story points and it had a medium priority. The permalink of the commit in GitLab can be found [here](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce293/ce293_team01/-/blob/d646d008737c5cf517649b7dbd6776472ccda779/Product_Development/Software/Code_Updates/Master_Code.c).

### Sprint 6 (Week 22 & 23):

- [This story](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-144) was assigned by Robert and compleated by myself in sprint 6. This story involved creating a top level README.md file. The top level README.md file contains the abstract and table of contents. I spent 30 minutes writing the abstract and creating the table of contents. The task has 4 story points and has a medium priority. The permalink of the commit in the GitLab can be found [here](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce293/ce293_team01/-/blob/master/README.md). 

- These stories [temperature and humidity sensor](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-146) (1), [speaker](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-182) (2), [ultrasonic sensor](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-158) (3) and [IR sensor](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-181) (4) was assined and compleated by myself. Story 1 (temperature and humidity sensor), 2 (speaker), 3 (ultrasonic sensor) and 4 (IR sensor) are unit test codes. I spent around 3 hours 10 minutes writing the code for the individual components used for the final project. The unit test stories for 1 (temperature and humidity sensor) and 3(ultrasonic sensor) are 5 story points each. The unit test for 2 (speaker) is 2 story points and 4(IR sensor) is 4 story points. The stories are low to medium priority. The permalink of the commit in GitLab can be found [here](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce293/ce293_team01/-/tree/master/Product_Development/Software/Component_Unit_Test). 

- These stories are the technical documentation for the temperature and humidity (1), speaker (2) and IR sensor (3). The stories were assigned and compleated by myself.

## ROBERT LEEDHAM 

### Sprint 5 (Week 20 & 21):
- [This story](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-136) involved creating a first edit of our project's master code and was jointly completed by myself, Ahmad, and Sagar. The team members met for a 2 hour stand-up meeting where we discussed sensor unit code and implemented their functionality to form a [skeleton code](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce293/ce293_team01/-/blob/d646d008737c5cf517649b7dbd6776472ccda779/Product_Development/Software/Code_Updates/Robert/Master_Code.c).
   
### Sprint 6 (Week 22 & 23):

- [This story](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-145) was created by Ahmad and assigned to myself. The work required the production of technical documentation for the RCCar7 code and took approximately 5 hours to complete. The document can be found [here](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce293/ce293_team01/-/blob/master/Product_Development/Software/Technical_Documentations/RCCar7_Technical_Documentation.md). 

- [This story](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-152) was created and initially left unassigned for a member of team to take responsibility for. The work required a draft of the testing report to be produced. I assigned this story to myself and produced the draft work - this involved producing and recording unit tests and results for each of the product's components. The draft took approximately 10 hours to complete and can be found [here](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce293/ce293_team01/-/blob/master/Final_Report/Product_Testing_Report.md).
