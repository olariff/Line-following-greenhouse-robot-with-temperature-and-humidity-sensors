# The Context
The product that has been designed is a pathfinder robot that will goes through the rows in an indoor greenhouse and monitor the temperature and humidity of areas in the greenhouse. When an issue is found then the onboard speaker will make a sound alerting the farmer where there is a drastic change in temperature or humidity. The farmer will have to layout a strip that will reflect light to the robot so that it can stay on track this allows for only specific areas of the greenhouse to be tracked if the farmer chooses to do this.

Due to the ongoing pandemic the initial project proposal has been changed and the design that has been agreed on is mainly created via computer simulation. This change had to be made as it is very hard to meet face to face and especially since this is a team project and there are multiple people on the project coming from different countries. The design that has come to has been developed online using various online simulation websites such as Mbed simulator and EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor).

However, while developing the product we were under the assumption that we have ordered parts for our project and have created a PCB design to reference to as well. We presume that all the parts we have order have had their unit tests passed and following all the work logged on Jira and Git the product can be recreated using actual hardware when possible and safe to return to the labs.
