# The Context
The product that has been designed is a pathfinder robot that will goes through the rows in an indoor greenhouse and monitor the temperature and humidity of areas in the greenhouse. When an issue is found then the onboard speaker will make a sound alerting the farmer where there is a drastic change in temperature or humidity. The farmer will have to layout a strip that will reflect light to the robot so that it can stay on track this allows for only specific areas of the greenhouse to be tracked if the farmer chooses to do this.

Due to the ongoing pandemic the initial project proposal has been changed and the design that has been agreed on is mainly created via computer simulation. This change had to be made as it is very hard to meet face to face and especially since this is a team project and there are multiple people on the project coming from different countries. The design that has come to has been developed online using various online simulation websites such as Mbed simulator and EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor).

However, while developing the product we were under the assumption that we have ordered parts for our project and have created a PCB design to reference to as well. We presume that all the parts we have order have had their unit tests passed and following all the work logged on Jira and Git the product can be recreated using actual hardware when possible and safe to return to the labs.

# Legal Concerns
Legal issues is a huge section that needs to be considered when putting a product out in the market or starting a business. It could be the deciding factor in the fate of the product. This is the reason why it is so essential to go through all the possible legal consequences the product could face and to find solutions to these issues.

### Licence Agreements 
There are various software licences that can be used to protect the written code of this product. There are lots of indications to take note of when deciding what licence to use, in order to avoid legal consequences on this end. An open source licence will be adopted as this enables code reuse up to a certain extent, and is a less strict option. The types of open source licences also have to be looked into, as there are about five of them with varying strictness levels. 

Out of these five, the decision has been made to make use of the public domain, which is not strict relatively. This is the most permissive type of software license. When software is in the public domain, anyone can modify and use the software without any restrictions. But you should always make sure it’s secure before adding it to your own codebase. Warning: Code that doesn’t have an explicit license is NOT automatically in the public domain. This includes code snippets you find on the internet.[1](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/5-types-of-software-licenses-you-need-to-understand/)

There are different techniques that can be undertaken to protect the physical product, otherwise known as the intellectual property. There are four main intellectual property protection methods that can be considered in this case, namely; Trademarks, confidential information, copyright and patents. For this particular product, the most reasonable course of action to take is applying for a patent. Therefore, in this case, only the design idea will be protected and not the actual code.






# Ethical concerns
In every aspect of life, ethics play an important role in maintaining a certain balance, as it draws a fine line between good and bad decisions and ensures both the workers and consumers of the product are not abused in any sort of way.
