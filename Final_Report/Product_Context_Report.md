# The Context
The product that has been designed is a pathfinder robot that will goes through the rows in an indoor greenhouse and monitor the temperature and humidity of areas in the greenhouse. When an issue is found then the onboard speaker will make a sound alerting the farmer where there is a drastic change in temperature or humidity. The farmer will have to layout a strip that will reflect light to the robot so that it can stay on track this allows for only specific areas of the greenhouse to be tracked if the farmer chooses to do this.

Due to the ongoing pandemic the initial project proposal has been changed and the design that has been agreed on is mainly created via computer simulation. This change had to be made as it is very hard to meet face to face and especially since this is a team project and there are multiple people on the project coming from different countries. The design that has come to has been developed online using various online simulation websites such as Mbed simulator and EAGLE (Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor).

However, while developing the product we were under the assumption that we have ordered parts for our project and have created a PCB design to reference to as well. We presume that all the parts we have order have had their unit tests passed and following all the work logged on Jira and Git the product can be recreated using actual hardware when possible and safe to return to the labs.



# Health and Safety
Robots and machinery are very common now and have been increased in popularity for  various different purposes. Workplaces now use machines to assist them in daily tasks to achieve the task quicker, efficient and much  more safer in some cases. Introducing robots in the work place alongside with humans however raises health and safety concerns. The main source of reported injuries are when the robot pinches or walks into a human by accident. 
However a certain portion of these errors or accidents are not directly the fault of the robot, the fault is the cause of the poor design and safeguards implemented by the human programmer that has designed the robot. The other side however is that there are also many humans working in the workplace some people do not know how to operate the robot and use them in a safe manner to avoid injuries to themselves and other people. The most likely reason for these injuries is caused due to a lack of education when the robots are introduced to the workplace. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_robotics_safety)

One of the main causes of injuries in the workplace is the miscommunication between humans and robots. This is why it’s important to keep in mind what purpose the robot is being designed for; industrial or for consumers.  The robots that are designed in an industrial environment are very fast and very powerful, depending on the design of the robot and the way they are built if there is an accident with a human the speeds and strength that the machine works at could lead to a very serious injury or in some cases there have been deaths reported. 

There are now guidelines and rules to prevent these issues from occurring. Workplaces have now introduced restricted or only authorised areas only. These have been designed so that only certain people can have access or people that have had professional training and can work with the specific equipment can only operate to maintain or repair the robot. These guidelines also need to insure that hazards that can not be predicted are thought of and there are steps to take if there ever is this issue occurs. 

To further minimise the risk of the hazards, present in the workplace it is required of workplaces to have an external moderator that will come and then assess the work conditions of the robots and human together. The risk assessments that are carried out are very important as they can give vital information on wheatear a human life is at risk or at danger and what steps should be taken to effectively get rid of this risk. If a repair or alternative way can be found these steps should also be taken as this may prevent a serious injury. In certain cases the feedback that may be given to a workplace could be a suggestion such as enclosing areas where the robot and human are isolated in their own respective areas, this would be designed so that the robot can operate at speeds that would injure a human however since a human can not get into this enclosed space the robot can be programmed in a manner that it would be stopped if told to either by a computer system or an emergency button. Further steps can also be taken such as using weight or infrared sensor that would force stop the whole system if a human that is unauthorized steps into the area. As health and safety laws evolve and change workplaces also need to adapt to ensure there is not only a safe working space for humans but also for robots as well.

For our project we will have to keep the mentioned health and safety ideas in mind. The robot we are designed will be inside an indoor strawberry farm. The robot will be going up and down lanes that have been premade by the farmer which is done via reflective stripes which the onboard infrared sensor are for. There is also a speaker which will b playing if there is a drastic temperature or humidity change or if the robot strays of path. There are two-line followers which will keep the robot in the middle so that it can be seen clearly. Another step that can be taken is too paint the robot in high visibility paint so that It can be seen easily in harder to see conditions.



# Legal Concerns
Legal issues is a huge section that needs to be considered when putting a product out in the market or starting a business. It could be the deciding factor in the fate of the product. This is the reason why it is so essential to go through all the possible legal consequences the product could face and to find solutions to these issues.

### Licence Agreements 
There are various software licences that can be used to protect the written code of this product. There are lots of indications to take note of when deciding what licence to use, in order to avoid legal consequences on this end. An open source licence will be adopted as this enables code reuse up to a certain extent, and is a less strict option. The types of open source licences also have to be looked into, as there are about five of them with varying strictness levels. 

Out of these five, the decision has been made to make use of the public domain, which is not strict relatively. This is the most permissive type of software license. When software is in the public domain, anyone can modify and use the software without any restrictions. But you should always make sure it’s secure before adding it to your own codebase. Warning: Code that doesn’t have an explicit license is NOT automatically in the public domain. This includes code snippets you find on the internet.

There are different techniques that can be undertaken to protect the physical product, otherwise known as the intellectual property. There are four main intellectual property protection methods that can be considered in this case, namely; Trademarks, confidential information, copyright and patents. For this particular product, the most reasonable course of action to take is applying for a patent. Therefore, in this case, only the design idea will be protected and not the actual code.

### Data Protection Laws
The Data Protection Act of 1998 governs data protection in the United Kingdom. However, 20 years later, with ongoing technological advancements, the legislation seems obsolete and irrelevant to the current data security issues. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will replace the Data Protection Act in May 2018, bringing with it a slew of additional obligations and penalties for businesses. There are eight of principles of data protection, and out of these eight, none of them apply to this product. This is because the product does not collect the personal data of its clients/consumers. Therefore, there are no worries on infringing these laws. However,data on the temperature and humidity of the environment is collected and these data on the organisation is to be kept securely within that organisation and must not have any third party involvement.






# Ethical concerns
In every aspect of life, ethics play an important role in maintaining a certain balance, as it draws a fine line between good and bad decisions and ensures both the workers and consumers of the product are not abused in any sort of way. 

An important aspect to consider for this product is how it affects the jobs of individuals in the industry. It is most certain that the release of this product into the market will result in the loss of jobs, however this is not an issue that is dependent on the production company to resolve. This is a major role the government play a significant part in, hence they are responsible for the resolution of this issue.

Code reuse of other individuals' work could be looked upon as stealing, which is morally unacceptable. Hence, the necessary referencing and acknowledgement must be put in place to avoid ethical implications. This also applies to any third party library/software used in the development of the product.

Although, every aspect of what is ethically acceptable/unacceptable cannot be covered, individuals are equipped with moral compasses and do not neccesarily need a code of conduct to decide what is right or wrong. Hence, discretion is to be used in certain aspects of decision making in ethics.
