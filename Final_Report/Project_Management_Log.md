# Project Management Log
- This markdown document describes the project management of the team for the Spring term. It is a continuing version of the Autumn term which has been illustrated in the [MVP Project Management Log](Final_Report/MVP/MVP_Project_Management_Log.md).  

## Project management discussion
- Team_01 has 7 team members who have been working collaboratively since the beginning of the academic year in order to deliver the final Product. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the team members have never met during the academic year. Therefore, they were relying on only the virtual tools in order to communicate with each other. It has been a challenging year for all the team members. However, the team has successfully managed to undertake the project resulting in a satisfactory outcome by the deadline.

- At the beginning of the Spring term, the road map of the project was not clear for the team. The reason for that was the uncertainity of whether there would be a chance to have access to the car in the labs or not. However, the team members were always meeting and disussing new ideas of how to adapt to that situation. With the help of the lab supervisors, the team has had an alternative plan to follow. The plan was to write a master code of the final product assuming that the unit tests have passed. In addtion, the components had to be shown how they can be connected together with MBED controller. After that, a PCB design was to be generated in the Eagle software.

- The team has started holding scrum meetings and initiating new sprints. in each sprint, the team has managed to accomplish a significant amount of work which would contirbute to delivering the final product in week 25. In each scrum meeting, each team member sugges new ideas. After that, the team agreed on a set of tasks to be achieved for the upcoming sprint. Each team member was assigned a couple of tasks to complete during the sprint. At the end of the sprint, the team met again in order to discuss the positive and negative points of the work that had been finished during the sprint. 

- Generally, the tasks were didvided into two categories. The first one was concerned about the software side of the product, while the second one was about the hardware side. The software side includes developing the master code which would be run on the car. In addition, each component had been techically documented. On the other hand, the hardware side was for connecting all component together in Eagle and developing the PCB desing of it. Three team members worked on the software side, whereas the remaining four worked on the hardware side. 

## Sprint Burndown Charts
- Below are three screenshots of the Burndown-Charts of three sprints. These three sprints were created and completed in the Spring term.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

- Burndown-Charts are used to depict how the story points are being burnt down during the scope of the sprint.

1. The Burndown-Chart which is depicted for sprint 5 shows that there were 40 story points to be burnt down during the sprint. The 40 story points have been completed by the end of the sprint. However, the chart shows that most of the work has been accomplished at the end of the sprint. Moreover, there were not any added issues during the sprint scope.

2. The Burndown-Chart which is depicted for sprint 6 shows that there were 95 story points to be burnt down during the sprint. However, the negative thing about this sprint was adding 26 story points during the scope of the sprint. On the other hand, all story points have been completed by the end of the sprint. the chart shows how the team was working over the whole period of the sprint to burn all story points down. 

3. The Burndown-Chart which is depicted for sprint 7 shows that there were 70 story points to be burnt down during the sprint. Most of the 70 story points have been completed in first half of the sprint. In addition, there were not any added issues during the sprint scope.


## Product Backlog
- Below are two screenshots of the Backlog area of our team in Jira where we keep all the issues that need to be accomplished. The issues are moved to the Sprints and assigned to team members. In addtion, there were a couple of risks which were kept in the backlog until the team makes sure that they can resolve them.
