## Risk Log

The success of any project is not guaranteed and will be prone to risks influenced by many different factors. With the ongoing covid-19 restrictions our project faces an increased element of risk which must also be accounted for. As such, at present there is several risks which threaten the success of our project; as a team we have begun to identify and track these with the aim of mitigating their effects.

#### _Risk:_ [_Poor communication_](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-100) 

- [x] Likely to occur
- [x] Major impact on project

_Overview_  
With current restrictions on face-to-face meetings, we have so far been forced to undertake the project fully online. This has resulted in team members working remotely from each other across different countries and time zones. With this added isolation it is more difficult for inter-team relationships to develop, and there poses a real threat of dysfunction developing and presenting itself in absence of mutual trust or commitment between team members.  In addition, the team comprises individuals from different backgrounds who will not express their thoughts in the same way as each other. If team dysfunction is allowed to develop, there will be an increased risk that some team members may feel left out, or unable to contribute.

_Mitigating actions_  
To counteract covid-19 restrictions and prevent breakdown of team relationship, we must endeavour to maintain frequent communications with all team members. Part of this will be to conduct mid-week [stand up meetings](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-98) which will provide the opportunity to update individual progress and highlight any obstacles that have been encountered. These will also give team members a chance to voice their thoughts or concerns on project direction.
