## Risk Log

The success of any project is not guaranteed and will be prone to risks influenced by many different factors. With the ongoing covid-19 restrictions our project faces an increased element of risk which must also be accounted for. As such, at present there is several risks which threaten the success of our project; as a team we have begun to identify and track these with the aim of mitigating their effects.

#### _Risk:_ [_Poor communication_](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-100) 

- [x] Likely to occur
- [x] Major impact on project

_Overview_  
With current restrictions on face-to-face meetings, we have so far been forced to undertake the project fully online. This has resulted in team members working remotely from each other across different countries and time zones. With this added isolation it is more difficult for inter-team relationships to develop, and there poses a real threat of dysfunction developing and presenting itself in absence of mutual trust or commitment between team members.  In addition, the team comprises individuals from different backgrounds who will not express their thoughts in the same way as each other. If team dysfunction is allowed to develop, there will be an increased risk that some team members may feel left out, or unable to contribute.

_Mitigating actions_  
To counteract covid-19 restrictions and prevent breakdown of team relationship, we must endeavour to maintain frequent communications with all team members. Part of this will be to conduct mid-week [stand up meetings](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-98) which will provide the opportunity to update individual progress and highlight any obstacles that have been encountered. These will also give team members a chance to voice their thoughts or concerns on project direction.

#### _Risk:_ [_Failure to meet deadlines_](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-99) 

- [x] Possible to occur
- [x] Catastrophic impact on project

_Overview_  
As all team members have other work commitments outside of the project, we must be aware that the amount of human resources at our disposal will not remain constant. There will likely be times when members are unable to contribute fully to sprints and tasks which, unless accounted for, risks the team successfully meeting deadlines. The same risk also presents itself from a failure to accurately estimate the complexity of assigned tasks. If we continually underestimate the time required to complete work, it will become more likely for us to fall behind schedule and fail to complete work on time. 

_Mitigating Actions_  
To help improve our estimation accuracy, we must ensure that assigned tasks are well defined and achievable. This will be achieved by including into our scrum retrospectives a discussion on the real time taken to complete assigned tasks against the estimates. Over time this will help improve scrum burndown charts which will better represent team performance.

To protect ourselves from busier working periods and provide a form of redundancy, where possible we will assign tasks to pairs of team members who will work together for the duration of the sprint. This will reduce the possibility of failing to complete tasks as it reduces the impact of individual work loads. We should still try and avoid this possibility, and team members should attempt to remain organised and inform the team at the earliest opportunity should they feel they will be unable to complete assigned tasks.

#### _Risk:_ [_Lack of project definition_](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-99) 

- [x] Possible to occur
- [x] Major impact on project

_Overview_  
 As the project progresses, the product in development will begin to take shape. With the ongoing communication problems we are facing, there is a possibility that obtaining and using regular client feedback could become more difficult, or we may struggle to implement feedback correctly. This presents a risk that the team may fail to develop a product that is fit for purpose and does not meet its specification. 

_Mitigating Actions_  
To maintain a clear image of how the product is shaping up, it is important that documentation is regularly updated. This will be the best method of ensuring that team members and the client can access the documents and are aware of what state the project is currently in. In addition, we must regularly assess the product against its specification to ensure we do not end up with a failing product.

#### _Risk:_ [_Data losses_](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A293011-102) 

- [x] Unlikely to occur
- [x] Minor impact on project

_Overview_  
Work that is stored digitally remains at risk of loss from hardware failure, or website crashes/downtime.

_Mitigating Actions_  
To minimise potential data loss, we will use gitlab as our main repository while team members will keep back-ups of work they produce (ideally using university server).
