As a team we have agreed to design and develop a path finder bot to monitoring temperature and humidity in indoor green house.

## Project: Path Finder for indoor green House (for monitoring temperature and humidity in greenhouse)

Some of the importance of managing temperature and humidity in a greenhouse are: 

-   Pests and disease control. 

        - Stressed crops are more expectable to pests and diseases. 
        - Mildew and mold can grow and spread quickly. 
        - Poorly controlled humidity can lead to perfect breeding ground for disease. 

-   Encourage crops performance for optimal growth. 

        - Steering the crops to grow to a particular growth cycle leads to high yield. 
        - Increase the ability of crops to take in extract nutrition for soli and environment leads to a tastier produce. 
        - Corps that require a particular environmental condition can grow. Example: Iceland (due to icy cold environment and geo-thermal warm soil vegetables cannot  be grown in outdoor farms) [1]. 

In a greenhouse the it is crucial to maintain a constant temperature and humidity. This is a tricky process as simply opening a door can create a micro climate. It is important that the temperature and humidity is equally distributed throughout the greenhouse to avoid microclimate. 

The main benefit of maintaining the temperature is a high yield of crops from a single plant. This increases the rate at which plants can grow and ensures that the plant keep producing goods until end of the growth cycle. In addition, with come crops the growth cycle can be increased or altered; where in some cases, ensuring that the plants keep producing good all year round. This helps the create a supply all year around for a highly desirable goods. 

The temperature and humidity go hand in hand as changing the temperature can change the humidity. There is no perfect temperature and humidity that fits all plants. It is important to find out the ideal temperature and humidity for a given crop. 

In an indoor greenhouse farms some of the methods used to control the temperature and humidity are fans, heaters, vents, shading cloth and fog machines. Our project proposal is a path finder vehicle that patrols around the greenhouse constantly monitoring temperature and humidity to ensure that there is no microclimate and the temperature is equally distributed around the greenhouse. The pathfinder will use sophisticated temperature and humidity sensor to record and compare with a reference values. If there is a huge temperature and humidity deviation the temperature, humidity location and time will be flagged. Furthermore as the project develops a networking stack will be used to control the temperature of the greenhouse.  


### Case study: 
- A perfect case study are indoor greenhouses Iceland, where high in demand vegetables such as carrots, cucumbers, potatoes and cabbages are grown all year around in to meet the demand. These are just a few examples and in addition, the crops are grown using electricity and heat produced by the geothermal energy [1][3]. 

- In the UK indoor farms are becoming a better model for growing plant based foods to change the eating habits. Indoor farming has been accelerated with the introduction of vertical farming where, crops are grown in a stacked system indoor under fully controlled conditions without the need for solar energy.

The case studies above are a great example of where are project is focused on. Growing crops indoor requires controlled conditions where temperature and humidity need to be controlled precisely for optimal growth. There is financial opportunities in a product which is able to control temperature and humidity. 


### Application: 

The greenhouse crop we have decided to focuses on is strawberries as it is a high desired crop recognized for their juicy flavor, deep scarlet colour and nutritional benefits. Strawberries are true local summer fruit and require a string of cool temperature to flower and hot, humid temperature to develop and constate their sweetness. They are widely used in desserts and dried breakfast cereal. They are a perfect example of a crop which is grown all year around in indoor greenhouse to meet the demand. To increase their sweetness the daytime temperature needs to be 24oC  and the night temperature 13oC. Cool night temperature allows the fruit to develop their flavor and hot day time temperature concentrate the flavor. The humidity need to be 60% to 75%, as it benefits the nutrition of the fruit [2]. Temperature and humidity is not the only factors which affects the growth of the fruit. Good quality soil is needed to increase its calcium uptake and sunlight is needed for photosynthesis to develop the deep scarlet colour. Temperature and humidity are importation to make sure that the crop can be grown all year around in an indoor green house.
